                battalion t-shirts! &nbsp;We are more than pleased how they turned out and cannot 
                wait until we get them in stock and start wearing them!!! &nbsp;While the order is 
                being processed the MSIV&#39;s will be going to each class and taking sizes and 
                orders. &nbsp;If you are NOT currently in a MS class and you want one of the t-shirts 
                you will be able to purchase them when they come in as well. &nbsp;</td>
